# TrainTracker

Welcome Aboard!

This is a train scheduler - use it to schedule your next trip.
The scheduler will accept train start information and frequency - and will display when the next train should be arriving, as well as how many minutes away that is.

Have a great trip!

This project involved working with FireBase to save the train schedule information and pass it back to the application.
